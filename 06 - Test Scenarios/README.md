## Overview

This folder contains well-structured test scenarios demonstrating my ability to craft behavior-driven development (BDD) style scenarios that bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation. These scenarios serve as a communication tool between stakeholders, developers, and QA engineers.

## Contents

*Coming soon - Test scenarios for various projects and applications*

## Scenario Structure

Most scenarios follow the Gherkin syntax:

```gherkin
Feature: [Feature being tested]

  Background: 
    Given [Common preconditions]

  Scenario: [Specific scenario name]
    Given [Precondition]
    When [Action performed]
    Then [Expected outcome]
    And [Additional outcome if applicable]
```

## Benefits Demonstrated

- **Clarity** - Plain language descriptions that non-technical stakeholders can understand
- **Coverage** - Comprehensive scenarios covering happy paths and edge cases
- **Traceability** - Clear links to business requirements
