# ðŸ§ª Test Scenario: TS-005

**Title:** Handle large textual requirement (boundary testing)  
**Objective:** Ensure performance and correctness when input is near size limits  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Preconditions:** System has defined input size limits  

---

## ðŸ“‹ Steps:

1. Paste a requirement >500 characters
2. Submit with another valid requirement

---

## âœ… Expected Result:

System accepts it if within limit; otherwise shows "Too long" error

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Test Focus:

- **Performance** - System response time with large inputs
- **Boundary Testing** - Behavior at size limits
- **Memory Management** - Handling of large text processing
- **User Experience** - Clear feedback on size constraints
