# 🔍 Exploratory Testing Overview

This section showcases my approach to **Exploratory Testing** — combining intuition, experience, and rapid feedback to uncover high-risk issues not easily detected through scripted testing.

## 🎯 Objectives:
- Identify hidden usability, edge case, or logic flaws
- Discover gaps missed in formal test cases
- Simulate real-world user behavior
- Apply heuristics for structured yet flexible exploration

---

## 🧠 Methodologies Used:
- **Session-Based Testing**: Time-boxed exploratory sessions with charters
- **Heuristics Frameworks**:
  - `SFDIPOT`: Structure, Function, Data, Interfaces, Platform, Operations, Time
  - `HICCUPPS`: History, Image, Claims, Comparable products, User expectations, Product, Purpose, Statutes
  - `CRUD`: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
  - `FCC CUTS VIDS`: Function, Complexity, Configuration, Usability, Time, Variables, Interoperability, Data, Security

## 🔍 Exploration Techniques:

### Tours
- **Feature Tour**: Systematic exploration of each feature
- **Scenario Tour**: Testing based on user stories
- **Risk Tour**: Focus on high-risk areas
- **Complexity Tour**: Testing complex functionality

### Personas
- **Power User**: Advanced functionality testing
- **Novice User**: Usability and guidance testing
- **Malicious User**: Security and edge case testing

### Heuristic-Based Testing
- **Error Guessing**: Experience-based bug hunting
- **Boundary Testing**: Edge of input domains
- **State Transition**: Testing based on system states
