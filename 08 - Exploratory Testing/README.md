## Overview

This folder contains session-based exploratory testing charters, notes, and findings demonstrating my ability to conduct effective unscripted testing. Exploratory testing combines learning, test design, and test execution into a structured yet flexible approach to discover issues that might be missed by scripted tests.

## Contents

*Coming soon - Exploratory testing sessions and findings from various projects*

## Exploratory Testing Approach

I follow a session-based testing approach with:

1. **Charter-Based Sessions** - Focused missions with clear objectives
2. **Time-Boxed Execution** - Typically 60-90 minute sessions
3. **Structured Documentation** - Consistent reporting format
4. **Risk-Based Prioritization** - Focus on high-risk areas first
5. **Heuristic-Based Testing** - Using proven test models and techniques

## Session Structure

Each exploratory testing session includes:

- **Charter** - The mission and focus of the testing session
- **Areas** - Parts of the application to be explored
- **Duration** - Time spent on the session
- **Tester** - Person conducting the session
- **Notes** - Observations during testing
- **Issues** - Problems found
- **Risks** - Potential issues or concerns identified
- **Test Coverage** - What was tested and what wasn't
- **Questions** - Areas needing clarification
- **Next Actions** - Recommendations for future testing

## Techniques Demonstrated

- **Tours** - Methodical exploration using patterns (feature tour, scenario tour, etc.)
- **Personas** - Testing from different user perspectives
- **Heuristics** - Using mnemonics like CRUD, SFDIPOT, FCC CUTS VIDS
- **Mind Mapping** - Visual representation of test ideas and coverage
- **Bug Hunting Patterns** - Focused techniques to uncover specific bug types

## Tools Used

- Exploratory testing notebooks
- Mind mapping software
- Session management tools (Session Tester, Rapid Reporter)
- Screen recording software
- Defect tracking integration
